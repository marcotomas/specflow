    In order to test my reporter plugin
    As a developer
    I want to run a predefined test suite

Scenario: eating (example 1) [OK] in 0ms
    Given there are 20 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms
    When I eat 5 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms
    Then I should have 15 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: eating (example 2) [OK] in 0ms
    Given there are 12 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms
    When I eat 5 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms
    Then I should have 7 cucumbers [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Nested step [OK] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When a child step was executed [OK] in 0ms
        When the tests run [OK] in 0ms
    Then a report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Single scenario [OK] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When the tests run [OK] in 0ms
    Then a report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Step is not implemented [Pending] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When a step is not implemented [Pending] in 0ms

Scenario: Steps contain arguments [OK] in 0ms
    Given a "awesome" scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When the tests with "multiple" parameters run "smoothly" [OK] in 0ms
    Then "1" report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Steps contain multi arguments [OK] in 0ms
    Given a "awesome" scenario is specified with a multi-line argument [OK] in 0ms
    """
    Here we go with mulitiple
    lines!
    """
    When the tests with multiple line parameters [OK] in 0ms
    """
    like
    this 
    one
    """
    Then "1" report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Step uses method-name undescores style [OK] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When a step uses method name style [OK] in 0ms
    And a step uses method-name style with two parameters [OK] in 0ms
    Then a report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Step uses method-name undescores style with table param [OK] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When a step uses method name underscore style with a table param and a second param [OK] in 0ms
    | Id        | Name      |
    | 1         | John Doe  |
    | 2         | Some Dude |
    | 3         | Any Guy   |
    Then a report is generated [OK] in 0ms

Scenario: Table param [OK] in 0ms
    Given a scenario is specified [OK] in 0ms
    When the a step contains a table and a "second" param: [OK] in 0ms
    | Id        | Name      |
    | 1         | John Doe  |
    | 2         | Some Dude |
    | 3         | Any Guy   |
    Then a report is generated [OK] in 0ms
